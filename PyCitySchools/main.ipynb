    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",

    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The study comprises the school data for the entire district, in which variables such as school type, student population and per-student spending were employed to parse the data against the metrics of passing grades for math, reading and combined, in order to find trends that explain the performance in those metrics and conclude which are determinant of a better or worse performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Findings:\n",
    " - As a whole, reading passing has faired better than math, both in average scores and percentage of students passing, which suggests more emphasis needs to be put in preparing students in math. The school with the lowest average math score in fact have low math scores in all four grades; this can help in identifying the schools were more immediate action is neeeded. \n",
    "\n",
    " - Charter schools outperformed district schools in overall passing rate. All top 5 schools were charter; in contrast, all bottom 5 schools were disctrict. This suggest emphasis needs to be put in supporting district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    " - surprisingly, schools with lower per student budget performed better than schools with higher per student budget. These schools tend to be charter schools, which in turn tend to be small in size. This suggests that the methodology of teaching and the student population (which could be a proxy for teacher:student ratio, although this is not shown in the data and it is thus an assumption) can be a better determinant of student success rather than budget allocation per se."
